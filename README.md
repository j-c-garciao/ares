# _ares_

_ares_ is a Java-based open-source desktop application for modelling instances of Maximum-flow problems (MFP) as flow networks. Also, _ares_ provides a process for computing not only the maximum, but also sub-maximal feasible flows. In such process, algorithm MFP2PNS transforms a given MFP-based flow network into a Process-Network Synthesis ([PNS](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0037(199803)31:2%3C119::AID-NET6%3E3.0.CO;2-K)) problem depicted by a structure constructed with P-graphs [P-graphs](https://p-graph.org/). Then, algorithm ABB (Accelerated Branch and Bound) of the P-graph framework take this structure and its underlying constrains as inputs and identify the maximum and sub-maximal flows. Several examples are provided in folder [Examples](https://github.com/j-c-garciao/ares/blob/main/Examples/).

_ares_ relies on the application _pgraph_solver.exe_ (refer to folder [PNSStudio_v2022/Solver/](https://github.com/j-c-garciao/ares/blob/main/PNSStudio_v2022/Solver/)), which is part of the [P-graph Studio](https://p-graph.org/downloads/), for computing the feasible flows.

## Examples

In the folder [Examples](https://github.com/j-c-garciao/ares/tree/main/Examples), seven examples are listed, each corresponding to different flow networks documented in the scientific literature. Example 1 is documented in the book _Introduction to Algorithms_ by Cormen et. al ([link](https://dl.ebooksworld.ir/books/Introduction.to.Algorithms.4th.Leiserson.Stein.Rivest.Cormen.MIT.Press.9780262046305.EBooksWorld.ir.pdf)). Example 2 is extracted from a paper of 2012 in the _Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics_ ([link](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82706025.pdf)). Examples 3, 4, and 5 are adapted from a manuscript published in the _Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering_ in 2023 ([link](https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/complete-limits-of-flow-network-based-on-critical-flow-concept-m/23529306)). Additionally, Example 6 is taken from [internet](https://www.coursehero.com/file/p6injoft/The-BMZ-Maximum-Flow-Problem-The-BMZ-Company-is-a-European-manufacturer-of/). Finally, Example 7 is adapted from a paper published in the _Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks Journal_ in 2023 ([link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352467721001156?via%3Dihub)). 

For each example, two folders are provided: ares and p-graph. In the b2p folder, you can find a file with the .b2p extension, which can be opened in the ares tool. There is also a subfolder named solutions, where you can find the .in and .out files required and generated by the [PNS_Solver](https://github.com/j-c-garciao/ares/blob/main/PNSStudio_v2022/Solver/), respectively. On the other hand, in the pgsx folder, you will find a file with the .pgsx extension, which can be opened in [P-graph Studio](https://p-graph.org/).
